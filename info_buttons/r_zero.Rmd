### Basic Reproduction Number
The average (mean) number of new infections created by a single infected individual when entering a completely susceptible population, i.e. when there is no immunity from past exposures or vaccination and no measures in place to reduce transmission. 

Estimates of the basic reproduction number for the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus are available from [**a review conducted by Liu et al. in 2020 (Table 1)**](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/27/2/taaa021/5735319). 
Estimates of the basic reproduction number for the Delta variant are available from [**a review conducted by Liu et al. in 2021 (Table 1)**](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/28/7/taab124/6346388).
